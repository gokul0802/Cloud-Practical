To inspect the quality of concrete structures, surface voids or bugholes existing on a concrete surface after the casting process needstobedetected.Toimprovetheproductivityoftheinspectionwork,thisstudydevelopsahybridintelligenceapproachthat combines image texture analysis, machine learning, and metaheuristic optimization. Image texture computations employ the Gabor ﬁlter and gray-level run lengths to characterize the condition of a concrete surface.Based on features of image texture, Support Vector Machines (SVM) establish a decision boundary that separates collected image samples into two categories of nosurface void(negativeclass)and surfacevoid(positiveclass).Furthermore,toassisttheSVM modeltrainingphase,thestate-of- the-art history-based adaptive diﬀerential evolution with linear population size reduction (L-SHADE) is utilized.+e hybrid intelligence approach, named as L-SHADE-SVM-SVD, has been developed and complied in Visual C#.NET framework.
Ex- periments with 1000 image samples show that the L-SHADE-SVM-SVD can obtain a high prediction accuracy of roughly 93%. +erefore, thenewlydevelopedmodelcanbea promisingalternativeforconstructioninspectorsinconcretequality assessment.1.Research Background +e construction industry is widely known as a highly competitive environment within which product quality is acrucialelementforacontractor’ssurvival[1].Inadditiontothe project cost and schedule, quality is a key factor thatdeterminescustomersatisfaction[2].Typically,forhigh-riseconcrete buildings, architects and project owners impose strictspeciﬁcationsontheconditionoftheconcretesurface.+ese requirements often involve the delivery of high-quality concrete surface with minimum presence of surfacevoids or bugholes [3].
It is because the phenomenon ofexcessive bugholes is one of the most serious and widelyencountereddefectson aformedconcrete surface[4]and isoftenasubjectofdisputebetweenprojectowners,architects,and construction contractors [3]. Surface voids (see Figure 1) generally refer to small pitsandcratersontheconcretesurfaceobservedaftertheprocess of formwork removal [5].+ese defects arebrought about by the migration of an entrapped air bubble to the interface between fresh concrete and formwork [6].+e diameter of these voids typicallyranges from several millimeters to 15 millimeters andeven25millimetersinsomecases[4].Formoredetailsonthe factors leading to the excessive presence of bugholes,readers are guided to the technical paper compiled byACI [4].In addition, bugholes are often distributedscatteredly on the concrete surface [7].
A high density of surface voids can result in several harmful eﬀects on the performance of concrete structures: (i) Bugholesobviouslyreducetheaestheticsofconcrete structures (ii) +ese voids reduce the protective depth of concrete structuresandmakethereinforcementsinsidethemmore vulnerable to corrosion [6]Hindawi Advances in Civil Engineering Volume 2020, Article ID 4190682, 15 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/4190682 (iii) For structures retroﬁtted by ﬁber-reinforced plastic (FRP)material,excessivevoidsreducetheadhesion properties of the FRP material applied to thestructure surface [8] (iv) Recent works have pointed out that salt accumu- lated in surface voids can lead to premature deg-radation of reinforced concrete structures [6, 9] (v) Existence of bugholes does increase the cost and time of painting and ﬁnishing activities becauseadditionalcorrectionsmustbeperformedtoachievea ﬂat concrete surface [5] Consequently, project owners and architects demand thatthenumberofsurfacevoidsonconcretesurfacesshould be limited to ensure the aesthetic appearance and durability of concrete structures.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License experience of inspectors with very limiting assistances of intelligent tools [4, 10–12].+erefore, the current structurecondition assessment process is notoriously time-consum-ing, laborious, and costly [7, 13–18].It is due to the sheervolume of surface area needed to be inspected, labeled, andreported.Moreover, as pointed out by Perez et al.
[19], the manual procedure also brings safety threat to human in- spectors since certain concrete surfaces cannot be reachedwithease,especiallyforthosewhicharelocatedathigh/rooflevels and narrow space. +e current practice is alsoproblematic due to the unavoidable inconsistency ininspecting outcomes.+e reason is that the assessmentprocess is dependent of subjective judgment of humantechnicians [2, 3].+erefore,projectownersareincreasinglyseekingfor fast, eﬀective, and consistent tools to better structurecondition assessment [19–24].+e assessment outcomes can also enhance communication between various stakeholders regarding the condition of the buildings.Image processing and machine learning with their fastpace of improvement provide feasible means to achievesuch goals.Processed digital images and machine intel-ligence are capable of automating the concrete surfacecondition assessment, especially the task of detectingsurface voids.
Hence, in the recent years, various state-of-the-art methods relying on these two aforementioned techniqueshave been proposed to tackle the problem of interest. ZhuandBrilakis[25]putforwardanimageprocessingapproach employing image segmentation and merging/splitting of pixels to detect air pockets on the concrete surfaces.Santosand Julio [26] presented an approach relying on the digitalimage processing and laser scanning techniques to analyzethe roughness of the substrate surface.Fekri-Ershad andTajeripour [27] put forward a robust approach based on aone-dimensionallocalbinarypatternforrecognizingsurfacedefect.da Silva and ˇStemberk [28] also employed image processing (i.e., image binarization and morphological an-alyses) and fuzzy logic to inspect the surface quality of self-consolidating concrete for precast members with a focus on the presence of bugholes.
Tajeripour and Fekri-Ershad [29] proposed novel one-dimensional local binary patterns usedfor recognizing abnormalities in stone textures. Kwasny et al.[30] investigated theinﬂuence of rheology onthequalityofsurfaceﬁnishofcement-basedmortars;thesurface voids existing on concrete were then analyzed andquantiﬁed via digital image processing.Sadowski andMathia [31] pointed out the needs of a more useful methodfor characterizing properties of a heterogeneous concretesurface; the authors also reviewed various image analyzingtools including image ﬁltering and transformation.+e eﬀectiveness of wavelet transform and Gaussian image ﬁl- teringindetectingsurfacedefectswerestudiedbyGo ¨ıcetal.[32].LiuandYang[33]extractedthefeaturesofbugholesona concrete surface via the utilization of the Otsu imagebinarization method.
A texture classiﬁcation model thatincorporates of gray-level run-length matrix and robustilluminationnormalizationtechniqueshasbeenconstructedbyDashandSenapati[34].Khanetal.[35]reliedongroundpenetrating radar to detect water inside the cavities ofconcrete hollow core slabs. Yoshitake et al.[36] relied on binary image and color image analyses to detect bugholes distributed on sidewallsandtunnel-liningconcrete.Perezetal.[19]utilizedthestate-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for detecting and categorizing building surface defects.A novel instance-level recognition and quantiﬁcation for concretesurface bughole based on the deep neural network has beenrecently developed by Wei et al.[18]; this study demon-strates a great capability of machine learning in identifyingconcrete void surfaces accurately.Nevertheless, the imple-mentation of deep learning models often requires a largenumber of training samples and a capable computingcapability.
As can be seen in the current literature, previous works have mainly relied on image thresholding methods for detecting concrete surface voids. +ese methods require substantialﬁne-tuningtoadapttovariablecharacteristicsofheterogeneous concrete surface [31].Due to the complexityof concrete surface background and varying lighting con-ditions,theaccuracyandapplicabilityofimagethresholdingmethods are generally limited.+erefore, image processingtechniques should be integrated with advanced machinelearning methods to deal with such issues.Hybrid imageprocessing and machine learning tools have demonstratedtheir outstanding performances in detecting concrete sur-faces in previous studies [15, 37–39].However, too fewstudies have dedicated to investigating hybrid image proc- essing—machine learning models for the problem of con- crete surface void detection.+erefore, the current work isan attempt to ﬁll this gap in the current literature.
Inthisstudy,imageprocessingtechniquesincludingthe Gabor ﬁltering and gray-level run lengths are employed tocompute image texture of a concrete surface with andwithoutvoids.+etextureinformationis,then,employedbythe Support Vector Machines (SVM) to discriminate thesetwo groups of concrete surface. Furthermore, since thetraining phase of the SVM-based bughole detection modelrequires a proper setting of the hyperparameters including the penalty coeﬃcient and the kernel function parameter, the history-based adaptive diﬀerential evolution with linearpopulation size reduction (L-SHADE) [40, 41] is used tooptimize the model training phase.It is because these twohyperparameters strongly inﬂuence the learning and pre-dicting performances of the SVM model.If the penaltycoeﬃcient and the kernel function parameter are not de-termined appropriately, the SVM-based surface void de-tection model cannot deliver the desired due to eitheroverﬁtting or underﬁtting phenomena [42, 43].
+e subsequent parts of the study are organized in the following order: +e second section reviews the researchmethodology including the employed image processing andcomputational tools, followed by the third section of thecollected image samples; the fourth section presents theproposed hybrid model used for automatic detection ofconcretesurfacevoids.+eﬁfthsectionreportsexperimentalresultsandconcludingremarksofthisresearcharestatedinthe ﬁnal section.AdvancesinCivilEngineering 3 7074, 2020, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/4190682, Wiley Online Library on [02/03/2025].
See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 2.The Employed Image Processing and Computational Intelligence Methods Since the surface of a concrete structure contains a diverse form of texture (e.g., intact surface, cracks, bugholes, andstains), texture information of an image region needs to beanalyzed to support the surface void detection process.Accordingly, a large image is separated into a number ofdisjoint image samples of 20 ×20 pixels via image cropping operations. Subsequently, numerical features are extractedfromthesesamplestoconstructthemachinelearning-basedsurface void recognition model.In this study, the Gaborﬁlterandgray-levelrun-lengthmethodsareusedforfeatureextraction.A novel method combining the SVM and L-SHADE is employed for data classiﬁcation.2.1.Gabor Filter (GF).
Gabor ﬁlters have been widely used fortexturesegmentationandfeatureextraction[44,45].Due to the capability of optimal joint localization in both spatialandspatial-frequencydomains,Gaborﬁlteringisaneﬀectivemethod for recognizing abnormal regions regular texturedsurfaces [46]. Various successful implementations of thistexture discrimination approach have been reported in theliterature [45–50].Basically, a two-dimensional GF is acomplexsinusoidalwavemodulatedbyaGaussianenvelope[51].+isﬁltercarriesoutalocalizedandorientedfrequencyanalysis of a two-dimensional signal.Mathematically, the responseofaGFcanbegivenbythefollowingequation[52]: h(x, y)exp − 1 2x2 σ2 x+y2 σ2y⎡⎣ ⎤⎦⎧ ⎨ ⎩⎫ ⎬⎭cos 2π u 0x   􏼁 , (1) whereu0denotes the frequency of a sinusoidal plane wave along the x-axis.σxandσyrepresent the space constants of the Gaussian envelope along the x- andy-axis, respectively.
Notably, Gabor ﬁlters with diﬀerent orientations can be attained via a rigid rotation of the x-ycoordinate system [46].+eFouriertransformoftheGaborfunctiondescribed in equation (1) can be expressed as follows [52]: H(u, v) � Aexp −1 2u−u0   􏼁2 σ2 u􏼢 􏼣 +v2 σ2v􏼨 􏼩+exp −1 2u+u0   􏼁2 σ2 u􏼢 􏼣 +v2 σ2v􏼨 􏼩 􏼠 􏼡, (2) whereσu� (1/2)πσx,σv� (1/2)πσy, and A�2πσxσy. It is noted that this Fourier transform of the Gabor function determinestheamountofeachfrequencycomponentoftheoriginal image that is altered by a GF [50].Notably, to construct Gabor ﬁlters used for texture computation, their tuning parameters including the orien-tation angles and the radial frequency must be speciﬁed.Assuggested in the previous work of Jain and Farrokhnia [52],0 °, 45°, 90°, and 135°orientations can be used.Moreover, givenanimagewithawidthof Nwpixelsand Nwisapower of 2, the commonly used radial frequency u0are as follows: 1� 2√ ,2�2√ ,4�2√ ,..
.,(N w/4)�2√ .Basedontheresponseofthe GF operations, statistical measurements can be calculated and employed as features for texture discrimination [53].2.2. Gray-Level Run Lengths.In this study, the task of concrete surface voids is formulated as image texture dis-crimination.+erefore, information regarding a set ofconnected image pixels with their distinctive pattern needsto be analyzed.Due to the complex nature of concretesurface,automatictexture discriminationisbynomeansan easy task.To deal with such challenge, statistical texture analysis models can be employed.Among the statisticalmodels, the gray-level run lengths (GLRL) [54] are veryeﬀectivetoextractinformationofanimagesamplebasedonsizes of homogeneous runs for each gray level [34].+e GLRL was ﬁrst proposed by Galloway [54] to distill discriminative features from terrain images.+is methodwas, then, applied and improved by various scholars forclassifying texture and other tasks in computer vision[34, 55].
+is texture computation method relies on the factthat image texture can be considered as a pattern of gray intensity pixel in a particular direction from a reference point [34]. Based on the analysis of second-order statisticalinformation, the GLRL computes the number of gray-levelruns which is a collection of linearly adjacent pixels withsimilar gray intensities.Given an image sample and a certain direction, a run- length matrix p(i,j) stores the information regarding the number of times that the sample contains a run length jof gray level i[54].Based on p(i,j) with diﬀerent orientations (e.g.0 °,45°,90°,135°),avarietyoftextureinformationcanbe obtained [56].
Basedonaconstructedrun-lengthmatrix,theShortRun Emphasis (SRE), Long Run Emphasis (LRE), Gray-LevelNonuniformity (GLN), Run-Length Nonuniformity (RLN),and Run Percentage (RP) are computed according to thefollowing equations [54, 57, 58]: SRE � 1 Nr􏽘M i�1􏽘N j�1p(i, j) j2, LRE �1 Nr􏽘M i�1􏽘N j�1p(i, j) × j2, GLN �1 Nr􏽘M i�1􏽘N j�1p(i, j) ⎛⎝ ⎞⎠2 , RLN �1 Nr􏽘N j�1􏽘M i�1p(i, j) ⎛⎝ ⎞⎠2 , RP�Nr Np,(3) whereMandNare the number of gray levels and the maximumrunlength.

+is stochastic searchengine relies on a novel integrated mutation-crossoveroperationtoexploreandexploitthesearchspace.Duringthelast decade, various enhancements of the standard DE havebeen put forward to improve its searching performance[62–65]. Among these enhanced DE variants, the history-based adaptive diﬀerential evolution with linear population sizereduction (L-SHADE) [40, 41] stands out to be a highlysuccessful version with competitive outcomes reported invarious comparative studies [66–69].+erefore, this im-provedversionoftheDEisselectedinthisstudytooptimizethe performance of the machine learning and image pro-cessing-based concrete void detection model.+e L-SHADE algorithm, proposed by Tanabe and Fukunaga [41], improves the original DE algorithm viaseveral aspects.First, the mutation scale (F) and the crossover probability (CR) are ﬁne-tuned adaptively during the optimization process instead of being ﬁxed.
Second, aneﬀective mutation strategy called DE/current-to-pbest/1 isimplemented to better explore the search space. +ird, apopulation size shrinking strategy is used to both enhancethe convergence rate and reduce computational expense.+e operational ﬂow of the L-SHADE algorithm is tersely presented in Figure 2.Since the L-SHADE inheritsthe main characteristics of the standard DE, its searchingprocess can also be divided into four steps of populationinitialization, mutation, crossover, and selection.In the ﬁrststep, based on the prespeciﬁed searched domain (lower andupper boundaries), the number of decision variable (N DV), andaninitialnumberofmembers(N M),apopulationof NM vectors is randomly created and expected to be distributedevenly throughout the searched space.In the second step, a new candidate solution called a mutated vector is generated via the DE/current-to-pbest/1 strategy.
+e DE/current-to-pbest/1 strategy used for generating a new candidate solu-tion is given by [40] v i,g+1�xi,g+Fixr1,g−xr2,g 􏼐 􏼑 +Fixpbest,g −xi,g 􏼐 􏼑.(6) In the third step, the crossover operation is used to combinetheinformationofthenewlycreatedcandidateandits parent according to the following manner [60]: u j,i,g+1 �vj,i,g+1 ,if randj≤Cror j�rnb(i), xj,i,g,if randj>Crand j≠rnb(i).⎧ ⎨ ⎩(7) In the last step, a greedy selection which compares the ﬁtnessofthecandidatesolutionanditsparentiscarriedout. It is noted that the L-SHADE employs archives of MF andMCR which are vectors of a ﬁxed length H; these two ar- chives store the mean values of the mutation scale and thecrossoverprobability.Moreover,thetwosetsofSFandSCRstoreallCRand Fvaluesthathelpedtoyieldchildsolutions better than the parents.After each generation, the current populationsizereducesviatheremovalofinferiorsolutions [41].2.4.Support Vector Machine.
Support Vector Machines (SVM), constructed on the basis of the statistical learning theory, are a robust method for establishing pattern clas-siﬁcationmodels.IntroducedbyVapnik[70],theSVMhave gained popularity in the research community via various works which reported their successful implementations[71–73].Itisbecausethismachinelearningmethodfeaturessigniﬁcantadvantagesincludingresiliencetonoisydataviaaframeworkofmaximummarginconstructionandcapabilityof handling nonlinearly separable data by means of kerneltricks. Furthermore, the learning phase of the SVM is boltdown to solving a convex optimization problem; thisguaranteesaglobalconvergenceandavoidsbeingtrappedinlocal optima [74].+e concept of the SVM used for concrete surface void detectionisdemonstratedinFigure3.+emodeldealswithnonlinearly separable data by mapping the data from theoriginal input space to a high-dimensional feature space; insuch high-dimensional feature space, linear separability canbecome feasible.
Given a training dataset x k, yk 􏼈 􏼉N k�1with a numerical feature xk∈Rnand corresponding class categories yk∈−1,+1{ } ,an SVM model establishes a classiﬁcation boundary to distinguish data from a positive class +1 (surfacevoid)andanegativeclass −1(nonsurfacevoid).Itis noted that a numerical feature xkis actually texture infor- mation extracted from an image sample using the Gaborﬁlter and the GLRL.

In each time of running, 10% of theoriginal dataset is randomly drawn out to form the testing dataset; the rest of the original dataset is used for modelconstruction. +e datasets used for time of model running areillustratedinTable1.Herein,thecolumnofsampleindex expresses the number of data samples employed in the training and testing datasets.In addition, to quantify the predictive capability of the proposed L-SHADE-SVM-SVD, the classiﬁcation accuracyrate (CAR), precision, recall, negative predictive value(NPV), and F1 score are computed from the four basicresultsofTP,TN,FP,andFN.+eseperformanceindicatorsare presented as follows [78]: CAR � TP+TN TP+TN+FP+FN×100%, Precision �TP TP+FP, Recall �TP TP+FN, NPV �TN TN+FN, F1Score �2TP 2TP +FP+FN.(19) +eL-SHADEwithaninitialpopulationsizeof30anda maximum number of searching generations of 100 wasutilized to seek for the most appropriate set of the SVMmodel’s hyperparameters.
+e searching progress of theL-SHADEmetaheuristicisgraphicallypresentedinFigure6.+e optimization process yields the penalty parameter (c) � 3.712 and the kernel function parameter (σ )�6.031. In addition, the statistical outcomes of the L-SHADE-SVM-SVD (mean and standard deviation) using the hyper-parameters found by the L-SHADE metaheuristic are re- ported in Table 2.+e averaging values of the CAR, precision, recall, NPV, and F1 score are 92.600%, 0.911,0.942,0.940,and0.926,respectively.Inaddition,theaverageruntimeoftheproposedapproachisroughly13.30seconds.Since there are 100 data samples in the testing set, thecomputational time used for classifying one testing datasample is approximately 0.13seconds.
Furthermore, to demonstrate the predictive ability of the newly developed L-SHADE-SVM-SVD model used forconcrete surface void recognition, the model performancehas been compared to those of Deep Convolution NeuralAdvancesinCivilEngineering 9 7074, 2020, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/4190682, Wiley Online Library on [02/03/2025].

+is statistical test is oftenemployed to inspect the null hypothesis that the model prediction performances of two machine learning models may be drawn from normal distributions with equal means.Herein, the signiﬁcant level (p value) of the test is set to be 0.05, and the results of the t-test are reported in Table 5. As can be observed from this table, the pvalues<0.05 reliably reject the null hypothesis.+is fact conﬁrms that the pro-posed L-SHADE-SVM-SVD is best suited for the task ofdetecting concrete surface bugholes.6.Conclusions Detection of a concrete surface is crucial for inspectingquality of cast-in-place concrete elements.
To enhance theproductivity and eliminate subjective judgment of concretequality inspection works, this research proposes an intelli-gent method that hybridizes state-of-the-art image pro-cessing, machine learning, and metaheuristic methods.Image texture is used as the input feature that characterizesthestatesofaconcretesurface.GaborﬁlterandGLRL-basedtextureinformationiscomputedandemployedbytheSVM 556065707580859095Classiﬁcation accuracy rate (%) DCNN-Adam DCNN-Rmsprop DCNN Sgdm MB-BPNN L-SHADE-SVM-SVD Concrete surface void prediction modelsFigure7: Box plots of model performances.Table4: Prediction result comparison.

+e integrated model, named as L-SHADE-SVM-SVD, has been developed and compiled in theVisual C#.NET framework to ease its implementation.+eexperimentaloutcomeusing1000imagesamplesanda repeated data sampling with 20 runs demonstrate thatthe newly developed L-SHADE-SVM-SVD is able toattain good predictive performances (CAR �92.600%, Precision �0.911, Recall �0.942, NPV �0.940, and F1 score �0.926). +us, the L-SHADE-SVM-SVD can be a helpful tool to assist construction inspectors in assessingconcrete surface quality.Nevertheless, since the current L-SHADE-SVM-SVD model aims at recognizing the status of no surface void andsurface void, the task of localizing surface voids on a con-crete surface image can be performed in a future study.
Inaddition, other future directions of the current works mayinclude the extension of the collected image dataset to en-hance the generalization of the developed machine learningmodel, investigation of other advanced metaheuristic al-gorithms to improve the surface void detection perfor-mance, and employment of other performance measurements such as model runtime [91].
